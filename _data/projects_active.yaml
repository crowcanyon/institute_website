#    The Inspiring Students Project is a partnership between Pueblo communities and the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center to develop student programs focused on issues that Pueblo people themselves have identified as priorities: the preservation of their native languages, cultures, and histories; providing culturally relevant educational experiences that inspire students to succeed academically and professionally; and creating more economic opportunities within native communities.

    It is difficult to overstate the importance of maize to Pueblo people, whose ancestral homeland includes southwestern Colorado. For archaeologists, the introduction of maize agriculture marks the beginning of Pueblo society. Similarly, Pueblo oral history ties their origins to the adoption of maize agriculture. As part of the Ancestral Pueblo Maize Database project, the Research Institute at Crow Canyon and the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office are building the first-ever comprehensive, publicly-accessible database of curated ancestral Pueblo maize. Through a series of workshops and museum visits, our team of Hopi scholars and archaeologists will assess connections between ancient maize and modern Pueblo varieties, and determine criteria that specimens must meet to be viable for future analyses. After filling data gaps on maize collections in Colorado museums, the team will develop a research design for a large-scale, multi-method analysis of ancient maize.

    The *Northern Chaco Outliers Project* focuses on the Haynie site, a multi-component ancestral Pueblo village with two Pueblo II period (AD 950–1150) great houses located northeast of Cortez, Colorado. The great and small houses at the Haynie site were part of the larger Lakeview community, a 1 km² area comprised of the densest concentration of great houses found north of the San Juan River. Previous research in the Lakeview group and an initial assessment of the Haynie site during the 2016 field season suggests that the great houses were constructed above earlier architecture dating to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods (AD 500–950). Excavation at the Haynie site will seek to determine precisely when the site was initially occupied, when it was subsequently depopulated, and how this related to other great houses located in the Lakeview community and the larger region. Data collected during the Northern Chaco Outliers Project will also allow contribute to a greater understanding of resource sustainability, the natural and cultural impacts of environmental downturns, ancient communities and regional systems, migration, and human/environment relationships.

    The *Crow Canyon Digital Archaeology Tools and Access* (CC-DATA) project will modernize Crow Canyon Archaeological Center’s research database to enable diverse forms of access for researchers, descendent communities, and the broader public. The project focuses on integrating legacy archaeological datasets recorded over the last 33 years with  born-digital  data such as drone maps, 3D laser scans, and digital photographs. This modern database will be deeply geospatial, and will enable connections to external collections databases. Building upon such a database, the CC-DATA project will develop digital humanities products such as richly-interactive data exploration tools and multivocal archaeology portals that blend Western and indigenous perspectives about the past. Crow Canyon has been a leader in completing archaeological research with the assistance of the public—this effort will invite the public to join in the co-creation of archaeological knowledge that is interdisciplinary, multicultural, and relevant in the 21st century.

    *The Effect of Crop Failure on Small Scale Village Organization* will study soils around Ancestral Pueblo villages in southwestern Colorado at a much finer resolution than ever before, asking, "during the latest occupations, when people moved to water sources and farther from their fields, what options and risks did they face in terms of farming opportunities?" This new project uses contemporary modeling approaches from surface hydrology to determine soil moisture potential in watersheds near villages. High-resolution images of landscapes around large villages will be obtained using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV or “drone”). Together, these data will be used to assess the risk of maize crop failure by determining which soils have high and low potential for reaching the wilting point for corn. Maps will be produced so that these dynamics can be studied from the village looking outward at the scale that past farmers walked the landscapes they lived within.

    *Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments* (SKOPE) is an NSF-funded effort to bring paleoenvironmental data to researchers and the public through an intuitive, map-based user interface, and also to improve the capacity of researchers to do reproducible paleoenvironmental research. The project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon, Washington State University, Arizona State University, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In response to a specific query, SKOPE will extract the latest data from diverse online databases. Using explicit and repeatable procedures, it will process the data to yield a cutting-edge synthesis of environmental information specifically tailored to the user’s request. Initially the tool will be developed for the Southwest US over the last 2000 years, but it will be designed to be readily extended to other places and times.

    Starting in 2011, Crow Canyon archaeologists, assisted by student and adult participants in the Center’s archaeology programs, began field investigations at selected Basketmaker III sites in Indian Camp Ranch. Because relatively little is known about this early chapter in Pueblo history―and because this was Crow Canyon’s first foray into Basketmaker archaeology―researchers had many questions. Where did the Pueblo people who first settled the central Mesa Verde region come from? How and why did early communities develop? What impact did a growing farming population have on the environment? And what are the environmental and social legacies of the Basketmakers on later Pueblo populations in the region?

    The Pueblo Farming Project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon and the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office to understand ancient maize (corn) agriculture in the Mesa Verde region through documenting traditional ecological knowledge, experimental gardens, and genetic analysis. Since summer of 2008, traditional Hopi farmers have traveled to Crow Canyon to plant maize gardens on the Crow Canyon campus. We've found that traditional varieties of Hopi corn, when planted using Hopi cultivation methods, grow well in the Mesa Verde region.

    The Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP) is a multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers at several different institutions to study the interaction between ancestral Pueblo people and their environment over more than a thousand years, beginning in AD 600. The VEP includes two study areas, one in southwestern Colorado and the other in northern New Mexico. Funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants awarded to Washington State University, the VEP employs an innovative approach to reconstructing the human past and exploring its relevance for today’s world. The VEP integrates three major studies: A reconstruction of the past environment; A computer simulation; and, An analysis of all known archaeological sites in the study areas. The VEP team included archaeologists, geologists, hydrologists, geographers, computer scientists, and economists from institutions across the U.S. and Canada. Between 2001 and 2014, this team completed a wide range of studies, and we continue to work on publications for both professional and public audiences. The VEP team also partnered with many other institutions and agencies, including the National Parks Service, National Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management. Together, we compiled datasets and developed techniques that we believe will be invaluable to others for years to come.
