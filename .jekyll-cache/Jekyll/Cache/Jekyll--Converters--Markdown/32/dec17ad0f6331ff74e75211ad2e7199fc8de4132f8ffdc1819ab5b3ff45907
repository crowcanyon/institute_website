I"<p>In 1993, the Village Mapping Project was initiated to obtain detailed surfacial information about Pueblo IIâ€“III villages outside the Sand Canyon locality. Thirty villages were initially mapped using orthorectified aerial imagery. Six of the 30 centers were then chosen for intensive mapping, architectural analysis, and a chronological analysis of pottery sherds on the modern ground surface: Albert Porter Pueblo, the Bass Site Complex, Seven Towers Pueblo, Cannonball Ruins, Woods Canyon Pueblo, and Hedley Main Ruin.</p>
