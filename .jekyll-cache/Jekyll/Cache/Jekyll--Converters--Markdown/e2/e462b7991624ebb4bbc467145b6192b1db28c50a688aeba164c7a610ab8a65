I"š<p>The Goodman Point Archaeological Project builds on the preceding community studies and involves excavations at the large village of Goodman Point Pueblo and surrounding smaller sites. Phase I of the studyâ€”<a href="/ResearchReports/GoodmanPoint/interim_reports/2005_2008/GPP_interim_report_2005_2008.pdf">Goodman Point Pueblo Excavations</a>â€”was conducted from 2005 through 2008; it involved test excavations at Goodman Point Pueblo (Site 5MT604), the large village that served as the focal point of a large community in the late A.D. 1200s. Phase II of the projectâ€”<a href="/ResearchReports/GoodmanPoint/interim_reports/2010/text_2010.pdf">Goodman Point Community Testing</a>â€”involves test excavations at multiple smaller sites surrounding the large village, including a variety of habitation sites, an ancient road, and areas that might have been agricultural fields, as well as testing of the Harlan Great Kiva site. We are also investigating the relationship of Goodman Point to Sand Canyon Pueblo as one of the few (and, perhaps, only) multi-village polities in the region. The final report for the Goodman Point Archaeological Project is nearing completion.</p>
