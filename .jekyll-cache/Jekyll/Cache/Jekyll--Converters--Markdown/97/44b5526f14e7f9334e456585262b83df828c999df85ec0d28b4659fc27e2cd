I"˜<p>A <a href="">new website</a> for the Research Institute at Crow Canyon was launched on May 20, 2016 as a subdirectory of Crow Canyonâ€™s main website: <a href="www.crowcanyon.org">www.crowcanyon.org</a>. The Research Institute is dedicated to the belief that archaeology can address many of the challenges facing society in the twenty-first century. Institute research will expand Crow Canyonâ€™s capacity in all three of its mission areas: long-term archaeological research, education about humans past and present, and partnerships with American Indians. As part of Crow Canyon, researchers at the Institute can leverage more than three decades of archaeological inquiryâ€”and an extensive databaseâ€”in support of sustained research leading to a better understanding of the human past and a clearer vision of societyâ€™s path forward.</p>
