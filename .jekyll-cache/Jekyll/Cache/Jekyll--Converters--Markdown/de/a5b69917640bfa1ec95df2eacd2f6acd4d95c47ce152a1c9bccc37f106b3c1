I"<p>Jonathan Dombrosky is a PhD Candidate at the University of New Mexico. He has collaborated with Crow Canyon since he was an undergraduate researcher. The bulk of his undergraduate and Master’s work comprised the analysis of faunal remains from a site called Ponsipa’akeri, located in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico. Additionally, he has synthesized archaeofaunal data from the Goodman Point Community Testing Project and helped analyze pottery sherds from the Basketmaker Communities Project for protein residues. He was a Crow Canyon Field Intern in 2015 and has assisted with College Field School since 2016. He is currently working with rabbit remains from Sand Canyon Pueblo to rigorously test whether or not garden hunting was a widespread subsistence practice in the Ancestral Pueblo world.</p>

<p>Jon’s dissertation work focuses on better contextualizing Ancestral Puebloan fishing strategies in the Middle Rio Grande region of New Mexico during the Pueblo IV period. He has created and lead a long-term project centered on understanding past management practices associated with birds of prey in the American Southwest/Mexican Northwest. Jon also has broad interests in human behavioral ecology, stable isotope ecology, and conservation biology.</p>
