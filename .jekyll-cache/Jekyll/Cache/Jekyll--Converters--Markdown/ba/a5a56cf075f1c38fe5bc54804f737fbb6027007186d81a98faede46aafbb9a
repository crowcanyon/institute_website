I"±<p><em>Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments</em> (SKOPE) is an NSF-funded effort to bring paleoenvironmental data to researchers and the public through an intuitive, map-based user interface, and also to improve the capacity of researchers to do reproducible paleoenvironmental research. The project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon, Washington State University, Arizona State University, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In response to a specific query, SKOPE will extract the latest data from diverse online databases. Using explicit and repeatable procedures, it will process the data to yield a cutting-edge synthesis of environmental information specifically tailored to the userâ€™s request. Initially the tool will be developed for the Southwest US over the last 2000 years, but it will be designed to be readily extended to other places and times.</p>
