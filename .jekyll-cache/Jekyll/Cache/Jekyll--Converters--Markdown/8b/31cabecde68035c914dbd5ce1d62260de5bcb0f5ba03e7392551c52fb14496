I"Õ<p>Starting in 2011, Crow Canyon archaeologists, assisted by student and adult participants in the Centerâ€™s archaeology programs, began field investigations at selected Basketmaker III sites in Indian Camp Ranch. Because relatively little is known about this early chapter in Pueblo historyâ€•and because this was Crow Canyonâ€™s first foray into Basketmaker archaeologyâ€•researchers had many questions. Where did the Pueblo people who first settled the central Mesa Verde region come from? How and why did early communities develop? What impact did a growing farming population have on the environment? And what are the environmental and social legacies of the Basketmakers on later Pueblo populations in the region?</p>
