I"#<p>The Pueblo Farming Project is a collaboration between Crow Canyon and the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office to understand ancient maize (corn) agriculture in the Mesa Verde region through documenting traditional ecological knowledge, experimental gardens, and genetic analysis. Since summer of 2008, traditional Hopi farmers have traveled to Crow Canyon to plant maize gardens on the Crow Canyon campus. Weâ€™ve found that traditional varieties of Hopi corn, when planted using Hopi cultivation methods, grow well in the Mesa Verde region.</p>
