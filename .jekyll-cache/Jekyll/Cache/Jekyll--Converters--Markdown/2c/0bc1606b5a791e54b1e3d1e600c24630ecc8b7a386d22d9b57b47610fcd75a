Stefani is interested in using the deep-time of archaeology to understand human resilience and vulnerability, calibrating our models of the present on the past. She is the director of the Coalition for Archaeological Synthesis funded <a href="http://archsynth.org/the-archaeoecology-project.html">ArchaeoEcology Project</a>. Stefani began collaborating with Crow Canyon researchers during the Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP) and was a field crew member for the Mesa Verde Community Center Survey led by Donna Glowacki in 2010â€“2012.</p>

<p>Stefaniâ€™s research interests include using agent-based modeling to understand the lifeways of the Ancestral Pueblo, using food web models to understand how Pueblo farmers were integral parts of a greater ecosystem, and using network approaches to understand the interconnectedness of the greater Pueblo world. She has also developed research in southern France, northern Mongolia, and the Western Desert of Australia.</p>
