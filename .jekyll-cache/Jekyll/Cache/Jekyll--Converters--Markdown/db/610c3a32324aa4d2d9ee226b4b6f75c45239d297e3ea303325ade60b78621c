I"l	<p>Kyle Bocinsky (PhD Washington State University 2014) is the Director of the Research Institute and the William D. Lipe Chair in Research, and a researcher with the Montana Climate Office at the University of Montana. In 2016, Kyle was the Director of Sponsored Projects at Crow Canyon. Kyle currently manages several Research Institute projects, including the Pueblo Farming Project, the SKOPE project, the CC-DATA project, and the computational legacy of the Village Ecodynamics Project. Kyle is a Co-Principal Investigator on a project funded by the National Science Foundation: Synthesizing Knowledge of Past Environments, or the <a href="https://www.openskope.org/" target="_blank">SKOPE project</a>. Kyle’s SKOPE research—managed through his Crow Canyon affiliation—develops large-scale, high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions for the southwestern US. Kyle is a long-time member of the Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP), and has been collaborating with Crow Canyon researchers for over a decade. He was part of the field crew in the 2009–2012 Mesa Verde Community Center Survey, and helped develop substantial portions of the VEP computer simulation of ancient Pueblo society. Kyle’s scholarly interests include computational archaeology, traditional ecological knowledge, complexity, human behavioral ecology, foraging theory, and plant and animal domestication. Kyle is the author of several software packages in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org" target="_blank"><i>R</i></a> programming language, including <a href="https://github.com/bocinsky/FedData" target="_blank">FedData</a> for easy access to federated datasets, and <a href="https://github.com/bocinsky/PaleoCAR" target="_blank">PaleoCAR</a> for high-resolution paleoclimate reconstruction. Kyle is a Co-Project Director of <a href="https://nativewaters-aridlands.com/">the Native Waters on Arid Lands project</a>, where he is working with an interdisciplinary team to enhance climate resilience on tribal land across the western US, and is also Co-Project Director of <a href="https://climate.umt.edu/mtdrought/default.php">the Montana Drought and Climate project</a>, where he is developing climate planning tools for agricultural producers in Montana. Kyle lives with his husband John and their golden retriever Molly in Missoula, Montana; he splits his time between Missoula and Crow Canyon’s campus in Cortez.</p>
