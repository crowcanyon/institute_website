I"H<p>The Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP) is a multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers at several different institutions to study the interaction between ancestral Pueblo people and their environment over more than a thousand years, beginning in AD 600. The VEP includes two study areas, one in southwestern Colorado and the other in northern New Mexico. Funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants awarded to Washington State University, the VEP employs an innovative approach to reconstructing the human past and exploring its relevance for todayâ€™s world. The VEP integrates three major studies: A reconstruction of the past environment; A computer simulation; and, An analysis of all known archaeological sites in the study areas. The VEP team included archaeologists, geologists, hydrologists, geographers, computer scientists, and economists from institutions across the U.S. and Canada. Between 2001 and 2014, this team completed a wide range of studies, and we continue to work on publications for both professional and public audiences. The VEP team also partnered with many other institutions and agencies, including the National Parks Service, National Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management. Together, we compiled datasets and developed techniques that we believe will be invaluable to others for years to come.</p>
