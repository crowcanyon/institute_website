I"·<p><em>The Effect of Crop Failure on Small Scale Village Organization</em> will study soils around Ancestral Pueblo villages in southwestern Colorado at a much finer resolution than ever before, asking, ‚Äúduring the latest occupations, when people moved to water sources and farther from their fields, what options and risks did they face in terms of farming opportunities?‚Äù This new project uses contemporary modeling approaches from surface hydrology to determine soil moisture potential in watersheds near villages. High-resolution images of landscapes around large villages will be obtained using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV or ‚Äúdrone‚Äù). Together, these data will be used to assess the risk of maize crop failure by determining which soils have high and low potential for reaching the wilting point for corn. Maps will be produced so that these dynamics can be studied from the village looking outward at the scale that past farmers walked the landscapes they lived within.</p>
