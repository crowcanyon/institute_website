            <h3 id="the-research-institute-at-crow-canyon">The Research Institute at Crow Canyon</h3>

<p><strong>The Research Institute at Crow Canyon is dedicated to the belief that archaeology can address many of the challenges facing society in the twenty-first century.</strong></p>

<p>Established in 2014 by the <a href="/index.php/board-of-trustees" title="Crow Canyon Board of Trustees" target="_blank">Crow Canyon Board of Trustees</a>, the Institute consists of an interdisciplinary network of scholars—archaeologists, economists, geographers, sociologists, educators, and indigenous culture specialists, among others—whose collaborative approach to research is especially suited to addressing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1324000111" title="Grand Challenges for Archaeology" target="_blank">big questions</a> with large and complex datasets.</p>

<p>Institute research will expand Crow Canyon’s capacity in all three of its <a href="/index.php/about-us" title="Crow Canyon mission" target="_blank">mission areas</a>: long-term archaeological research, education about humans past and present, and research partnerships with Native Americans. As part of Crow Canyon, researchers at the Institute can leverage more than three decades of archaeological inquiry—and an extensive database—in support of sustained research leading to a better understanding of the human past and a clearer vision of society’s path forward.</p>

<p>Projects conducted under the aegis of the Institute address a wide variety of interrelated issues relevant not only to archaeologists but to educators, policy makers, advocacy groups, and indigenous peoples:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Human-environment relationships</dt>
  <dd>What effect do people have on the natural environment? How does a changing environment affect human societies? An understanding of how humans have responded to environmental change in the past can inform discussions of environmental policy today.</dd>
  <dt>Economic systems</dt>
  <dd>Studies of economic performance in ancient societies worldwide provide valuable historical and cross-cultural perspectives on long-term economic sustainability and unsustainability.</dd>
  <dt>Social complexity</dt>
  <dd>Human societies have grown exponentially in scale and complexity over the past 10,000 years. Institute studies help identify the factors that shape the development human societies and create an appreciation for human cultural diversity. On a planet that today is inhabited by more than 7 billion people, the past can teach us about the social frameworks that are needed to manage future growth.</dd>
  <dt>Indigenous archaeology</dt>
  <dd>Archaeology conducted by and in collaboration with indigenous people promotes respect for different cultures, traditional knowledge, and the full range of creative solutions that different peoples have brought to bear on problems common to all societies, past and present. The Institute will facilitate these collaborative endeavors and support the work of indigenous scholars who seek to develop an archaeology based on indigenous perspectives.</dd>
  <dt>Cultural and scientific literacy</dt>
  <dd>As a social science that integrates the “hard” sciences into its practice, archaeology is an excellent way for students to acquire basic cultural and scientific literacy—and to learn how to apply those skills in real life.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The ultimate goal of the Institute is to offer research-based solutions to real problems. It’s ambitious, but the potential exists for archaeology—long regarded as simply the study of antiquity—to provide fresh perspectives on some of the most intransigent, and controversial, issues of our time.</p>

            <p>Peggy Nelson is President’s Professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change and Vice Dean of Barrett Honors College at Arizona State University. She has conducted research in the Mimbres region of southwest New Mexico for over 30 years, collaborating for the past 20 years with Dr. Michelle Hegmon. Their work focuses primarily on the Classic to Postclassic transformation. Nelson’s 1999 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mimbres-during-Twelfth-Century-Reorganization/dp/0816518688"><em>Mimbres During the 12th Century: Abandonment, Continuity, and Reorganization</em></a>, derives from that research. Her 2010 book <a href="https://sarweb.org/?sar_press_mimbres_lives_and_landscapes"><em>Mimbres Lives and Landscapes</em></a>, edited with Hegmon, brings many specialists together in a popular book about archaeology and Mimbres culture. Most recently she leads two interdisciplinary research teams. The first addresses social-ecological issues concerning vulnerability and resilience for prehistoric small-scale farmers in the US Southwest (600–1500 CE) and the lessons learned from this research for contemporary issues of resilience and sustainability. This work has been published as a <a href="https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss1/art25/">Special Feature</a> for the journal <em>Ecology and Society</em>. The second is a collaboration with the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization to assess the role of human-made vulnerabilities in the scale of impacts from climate challenges. This work directly addresses concerns within the disaster management community and was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1506494113">recently published</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Nelson was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2008. She has been named Centennial Professor, Parents Association Professor of the Year, and ASU President’s Professor in recognition of her teaching.</p>

            <p>Chip Stanish is a professor in the department of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles and the director of the Cotsen Institute.  His research interests include Andean archaeology, complex society, and political economy. The Lake Titicaca Basin in highland Peru and Bolivia represents one of the great centers of preindustrial civilization in the world. His survey and excavations along the shores and on the islands of Lake Titicaca have uncovered numerous sites that span more than six millennia of human occupation. Recently, he has been excavating the remains of a house from the seventh to ninth century AD on the Island of Esteves, near the northern shore of the lake. This architecture was associated with a large pyramid and temple complex that was the center of the Tiwanaku (ca. AD 400–1000) state’s provincial administration of this territory. The high quality of pottery and other objects associated with this house complex indicates that it was inhabited by an elite group, possibly Tiwanaku administrators or artisans. Chip has numerous publications and grant awards, and is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Lloyd Cotsen Chair of Archaeology, and a Senior Fellow at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library.</p>
