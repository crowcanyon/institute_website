            <p>The <a href="https://www.crowcanyon.org/institute/" target="_blank">Research Institute at Crow Canyon Archaeological Center</a> invites applications for a two year Postdoctoral Scholar in Pottery Analysis position as part of the <a href='https://www.crowcanyon.org/index.php/northern-chaco-outliers-project-2019' target="_blank">Northern Chaco Outliers Project</a>, starting in Summer 2019. We invite applications from scholars who have completed a PhD (ABD with defense date scheduled will be considered) and have research experience with archaeological pottery of the US Southwest. The research focus of this postdoctoral appointment will be on artifacts from the Northern Chaco Outliers Project, with an emphasis on pottery from Wallace Ruin.</p>

            <p>The successful Scholar will be an integral part of the Research Institute and Archaeology departments at Crow Canyon, and will be encouraged to engage in collaborations with Crow Canyon staff and external Research Associates. The Postdoctoral Scholar will receive support to attend professional conferences and workshops, and additional internal research funding is available. This position is funded in part by the William D. Lipe Advances in Research program at the Research Institute.</p>

            <p>The Northern Chaco Outliers Project focuses on the Haynie site, a multi-component ancestral Pueblo village with two Pueblo II period (A.D. 950–1150) great houses located northeast of Cortez, Colorado. The great and small houses at the Haynie site were part of the larger Lakeview community, a 1 km² area comprised of one of the densest concentrations of great houses found north of the San Juan River. Two other great house sites, Wallace Ruin and Ida Jean Pueblo, are included in the Lakeview community. Analyses of pottery from Wallace Ruin will seek to determine precisely when the site was initially occupied, when it was subsequently depopulated, and how this village related to other great houses located in the Lakeview community and the larger Chaco regional system. Data collected during the Northern Chaco Outliers Project will also contribute to a greater understanding of resource sustainability, the natural and cultural impacts of environmental downturns, ancient communities and regional systems, migration, and human/environment relationships.</p>
