            <p>The Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) of the National Science Foundation offers <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16590/nsf16590.htm" target="_blank">Postdoctoral Research Fellowships</a> (SPRF) to encourage independence early in the Fellow's career through supporting his or her research and training goals. These <b>two-year fellowships</b> enable recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, <b>including those from underrepresented groups</b>, in its research programs and activities. Each fellow is mentored by one or more sponsoring scientists at a host institution.
            </p>

                <b>The SPRF program offers two tracks:</b>

            <ul style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">

                <li><b>Fundamental Research in the SBE Sciences</b> supports research that builds fundamental knowledge of human behavior, interaction, social and economic systems, organizations and institutions</li>

                <li><b>Broadening Participation in the SBE Sciences</b> offers fellowships in an effort to increase the diversity of post-doctoral level researchers who participate in NSF programs in the social, behavioral and economic sciences and thereby increase the participation of scientists from underrepresented groups in selected areas of science in the United States</li>

            </ul>

                <b>The <a href="/" target="_blank">Crow Canyon Archaeological Center</a> in rural southwestern Colorado is soliciting collaborations with potential SPRF fellows as a host institution.</b> The Center’s mission is to advance and share knowledge of the human experience through archaeological research, education programs, and partnerships with American Indians. Archaeologists at Crow Canyon work collaboratively with American Indian partners to protect and preserve cultural resources, to develop and deliver educational programming based on our research, and to make significant contributions to understanding the human past and the broader human experience. Postdoctoral scholars at Crow Canyon will work closely with sponsoring scientists from across the institution on research projects that align with our <a href="/institute/projects/" target="_blank">currently established research programs</a>, and/or that leverage Crow Canyon <a href="/ResearchReports/ResearchDatabase/database_home.asp" target="_blank">archaeological data</a> and existing collaborations to bring Crow Canyon research in new and exciting directions. Postdoctoral scholars will be supported by the new <a href="/institute/" target="_blank">Research Institute at Crow Canyon</a>, and will join a diverse and vibrant research community. We also invite co-sponsored proposals with one of Crow Canyon’s <a href="/institute/people/#associates" target="_blank">Research Associates</a>.
